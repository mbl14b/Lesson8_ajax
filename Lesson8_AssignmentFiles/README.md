### Project Description:
(This assignment was all about building an application that displayed info about movies. We used jQuery and AJAX methods to parse JSON data returned from a 3rd party server called OMDB API (or Application Programming Interface, from an HTTP response message)  and used Ajax methods & properties that allow the client to send an HTTP request to recieve back an HTTP response. )

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (An API, or Application programming interface is a set of programming instructions/standards to access web-based software applications or web tool. A software company releases its API to the publicin order for other software developers to design products that are powered bu its service.)
2. (AJAX, or Asynchronous Javascript and XML, is technology that allows people to load date from a server without a browser page refresh. This allows for creating better, faster and mroe interactive web apps. Apps using AJAX are considered data-driven as opposed to page-driven.)
3. (JSON, or Javascript Object Notation and XML, is a lightweight text-based open standard designed for human-readable data interchange. It extends the JavaScript scripting language. It is primarily used to transmit data between a server and web apps. It is very useful, as web services and APIs use this format to provide public data.)
